# ACM CP Event Details

## Overview
The objective of this event is to get members coding and practicing problems outside of the classroom. 

These problems will be similar to ones asked in technical interviews (eg. solving problems from Leetcode). Large competitive programming events are also actually held; Google and Facebook have ones with $15,000/20,000 prizes!

## Groups
The event will be separated into two groups: beginners/easy and advanced/medium.

Beginners group will consist of freshman, sophomores, those who haven't completed or are currently taking `CS 2013`, and non-CS majors.

Advanced group will consist of juniors, seniors, and others up for the challenge.

## Process:
* Discuss Instructions for the event
* Spend 1.5 - 2 hours coding (vote)!
* The remaining time will be to review and share solutions

## Instructions:
Please read the questions carefully and try to come up with an effective solution. 

Note that there will be a time limit for how long these programs can run (1-2 seconds). This means if you write something like 5 nested for-loops, your program will likely exceed the time limit. 

### Accepted Languages: 
* C++
* Java
* Python

### Submission:
* Create a file for each problem
    * name them `b1`, `b2`, ... for the beginners group 
    * name them `a1`, `a2`, ... for the advanced group
    * remember to use the correct file extension! eg. `a1.java`
* Inside the file, write a function `solve()` that matches the problem criteria
* For inputs/parameters to the solve function, if you are given an integer, accept an int for C++/Java. If you are given a list:
    * Accept a vector for C++
    * Accept an array for Java
    * Accept a list for Python
* When completed, check that your solution works for the provided examples
* Once ready to submit, send the file to `acmcsula.cp@gmail.com` with an email subject of `Name - Easy` or `Name - Medium`, eg. `John Doe - Medium`
    * no need to waste time typing anything else

### Scoring Criteria:
* You will gain some number of points per problem solved
* Person with the highest amount of points will win (total points of 21 for each group)
* Tiebreakers will be decided by total time spent
    * person with shortest time will win 
    * NOTE: each incorrect submission will add 3 minutes to your time

### I'm here for only learning:
* If you'd like to not "compete," and instead work with others/get hints, please let us know!
* Breakout rooms will be open for people to work together
* Keep in mind you will not be eligible for actually "winning" the competition

## Good luck!
